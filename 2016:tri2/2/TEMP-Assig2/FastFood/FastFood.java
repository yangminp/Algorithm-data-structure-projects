/** The FastFood game involves customers who generate orders, and the player
 *  who has to fulfill the orders by assembling the right collection of food items.
 *  The goal of the game is to make as much money as possible before
 *  the player gets too far behind the customers and is forced to give up.
 *
 *  The game presents the player with a queue of orders in a fast food outlet.
 *  The player has to fullfill the customer orders by adding the correct items to
 *  the order at the head of the queue.  
 *  When the order is ready, the player can deliver the order, which will
 *  take it off the queue, and will add the price of the order to the balance.
 *  Whenever the player adds an item to the order that doesn't belong in the
 *  order, the price of the item is subtracted from the balance.
 *  The player can practice by generating orders using the Practice button.
 *  Once the game is started, the orders are generated automatically.
